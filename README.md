ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I'm a self-taught web developer with a strong passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. I thrive on learning and mastering new technologies, and I enjoy building solutions that bridge the gap between the front-end and back-end of web development.

ðŸš€ Skills
Front-end Development: Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and modern frameworks like React and Vue.js. I focus on creating responsive and interactive user interfaces that enhance user experience.

Back-end Development: Experienced with Node.js, Express, and databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I build robust and scalable APIs and server-side applications that power web projects.

Continuous Learning: Always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in web development. I actively seek opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge.

ðŸŒ± Current Focus
Currently, I'm exploring advanced JavaScript concepts, refining my skills in full-stack development, and contributing to open-source projects. I'm also working on several personal projects to apply what I learn and solve real-world problems.
